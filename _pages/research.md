My research focuses on understanding how people interact with information in onliny systems. Broadly, the topics I have researched include recommender systems, information systems, user modelling and personalization. Specific focuses have been on 

- **Evaluation**: what it is that people expect from intelligent systems
- **Reproducibility**: how can we recreate the results that others have attained
- **Context**: how relevance changes depending on the situation in which a person uses the system
- **Health**: how can intelligent information systems be used to help people lead healthier lives

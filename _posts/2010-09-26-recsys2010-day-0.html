excerpt: "gearing up for RecSys"
---
<p>I'm in Barcelona, at a hotel a stone's throw from Parc de la Ciutadella, getting ready for RecSys2010.</p>
<p>Arrived here yesterday and spent most of the day in my hotel room working on my slides for my presentation at the Doctoral Symposium tomorrow. Or at least, I planned on working on them. This being my first off day since I don't know when, I spent most of the day planning on finishing my slides.</p>
<p>So now, just after 2:10AM I finished them, a whole 14 hours before my presentation. In between I had time to go for dinner and drinks with some of the usual RecSys suspects and some of the not so usual RecSys suspects. One thing was clear tho, everyone seems to have high anticipaitons for this conference. You can see it on <a title="twitter" href="https://twitter.com/#search?q=%23recsys" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, you can see it by the number of <a title="RecSys 2010" href="http://twitter.com/recsys2010/status/24699228781" target="_blank">registered participants</a> and you can see it on the popularity of the workshops, even <a title="Wired Womrad" href="http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2010-09/07/lastfm-clock-data-viz" target="_blank">Wired</a> had a story on one of them.</p>
<p>This will be my second RecSys, and the fourth time RecSys takes place. Last year's RecSys has been the baseline to which I've compared other conferences (overall quality), I hope the baseline from now on will be this year's conference instead.</p>

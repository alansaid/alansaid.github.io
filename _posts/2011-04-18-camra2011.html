<p>It's official since a couple of minutes, there will be a 2nd Challenge on Context-aware Movie Recommendation at <a title="RecSys2011" href="http://recsys.acm.org/2011/" target="_blank">RecSys2011</a>.</p>
<p>Needless to say we're excited. The focus this year will be a bit different from last <a title="CAMRa2010" href="http://dai-labor.de/camra2010" target="_blank">year's CAMRa</a>, we're aiming at a social context this year which will include household information. We're working on a website which should be available soon at <a title="CAMRa2011" href="http://camrachallenge.com" target="_blank">CAMRa2011</a>.</p>
<p>This year we're teaming up with <a title="Moviepilot" href="http://moviepilot.de" target="_blank">Moviepilot</a> again and will be releasing another batch of interesting datasets.</p>

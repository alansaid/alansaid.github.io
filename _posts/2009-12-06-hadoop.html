<p>Spent an evening a couple of days ago setting up a single node <a title="Hadoop" href="http://hadoop.apache.org/" target="_blank">Hadoop</a>-cluster. It turned out to be a pretty simple process, mainly thanks to Michael G. Knoll's great <a title="Hadoop tutorial" href="http://www.michael-noll.com/wiki/Running_Hadoop_On_Ubuntu_Linux_%28Single-Node_Cluster" target="_blank">tutorial</a>, although it did not cover all the details, it prooved to be of great help.</p></p>
<p>Haven't really had time to test the setup yet, will post an update when I have. Next step will be to setup a multi-node cluster and see how <a title="MapReduce" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce" target="_blank">MapReduce</a> programs perform.</p></p>

  content: Great question - reminds me of Gladwell's supposition that Social Media
    interaction is only able to spur small or short term action and as such can't
    build much momentum or attain much impact. If I look at my "longer media" consumption
    over the past 12 months though - much of it has been impacted by my social graph
    - both online and offline. Ultimately, I value even more highly the things that
    have been recommended to me in both spheres. Let me know when you put the survey
    together. I'd be happy to participate.

    I think everybody would say that this correlates just as easier-to-consume media. But certainly the conversion rate is not as big. It's like buying expensive, high-involvement goods: You think twice and don't buy them ad-hoc.
    However, you definitely should include to ask for the strength of the tie in your survey. You definitely would not consider reading a book from a weak tie, would you?
    I'd be glad to participate in your survey!

  content: It seems logical that what your social circle is talking about affects
    you making it easier that you buy some film, book or whatever product/brand
    they are talking about. But I miss some serious study about that. I'm tired to
    read about how brands are able to connect their customers through Social Media,
    stating that Social Media helps brands to sell more. Is that true? It seems logical,
    but there is no research analyzing long-term relationships among brands and users.

    I think that the amount of time that I have to invest to "consume" some media that has been recommended by an online contact (e.g., viral videos on facebook, reading a book recommended by a friend) reflects on the nature of the link/friendship that I share with that person.

    For example, any on the contacts I follow on twitter may post a youtube video that I will watch, but many of them post book reviews for books I will never read. On the other hand, if one of my (more trusted) contacts says "neal, you should read (watch/listen to) this," I will be more likely to go for it. In these cases, not only is similarity coming into play, but so is the knowledge that my contact has about who I am and what I will like.

<p>A couple of weeks ago I noticed that the vast majority of my YouTube consumption came from links people in my Twitter, Facebook, etc. feeds posted to their timelines.</p>
<p>This got me thinking. How is our media consumption affected by our feeds (or our friends feeds actually)? Which types of media are affected more than others? For instance, watching a YouTube video, listening to a song or reading a news article online is a relatively small effort and a small "cost" (meaning time). It's a click away and will take ten minutes at most.</p>
<p>Reading a book or watching a movie on the other hand comes with a significantly higher cost. First you'll have to get the movie or the book, and then spend a substantial period of time either reading or watching the item.</p>
<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-748"></a>Does this mean that only "short" media consumption is affected by our online friends? Or are we also investing time and money in the things we see our friends talk about?</p>
<p>How does this correlate to online recommendation sites which have a social network? Are we more inclined to see movies, read books and buy items that our friends have already seen/read/bought? Do we perhaps do that automatically since we probably share some values/interests with our friends anyway?</p>
<p>I had a short (in length and substance) paper at the <a title="SRS2010" href="http://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/~lichen/srs2010/" target="_blank">Workshop on Social Recommender Systems</a> at the <a title="IUI" href="http://iuiconf.org" target="_blank">IUI 2010</a> conference titled <a title="Social Relations [PDF]" href="http://bit.ly/hJPlpv" target="_blank">How Social Relationships Affect User Similarities</a> where I discussed the fact that users who are friends in the <a title="Filmtipset" href="http://filmtipset.se" target="_blank">Filmtipset</a> online movie recommendation website had larger similarities to each other than to unrelated users. One thing I could not test however was whether users had watched a movie after they had seen it in their friends feed, or simply because they shared an interest in the movie with their friends.</p>
<p>The question I'm trying to ask is: How do our social ties actually affect our "long" (or costly) media intake?</p>
<p>I thought I'd set up an online questionnaire and ask people to answer some questions. However, before I do that, I might try to generate some discussion on the topic, trying to find the right questions to ask as well as trying to find any related litterature there is.</p>
<p>Please post comments, litterature, or any relevant ramblings either as comments here or to <a title="Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/alansaid" target="_blank">@alansaid</a></p>

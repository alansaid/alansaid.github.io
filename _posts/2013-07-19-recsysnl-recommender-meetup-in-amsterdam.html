<p>On August 19th we will be organizing the first <a title="Amsterdam Recommenders" href="http://www.recommenders.nl" target="_blank">Amsterdam Recommender Meetup</a>. The meetup will be hosted by <a title="CWI" href="http://www.cwi.nl" target="_blank">CWI</a> and will feature a few (2-3) talks by recommender system practitioners describing problems/solutions related to data, recommendation, interaction, etc. they deal with in their systems.</p>
<p>The event, which hopefully will become a recurring thing, is in the same spirit as the <a title="Recommender Stammtisch" href="http://www.recommenders.de" target="_blank">Recommender Stammtisch</a> that we kicked off last year in Berlin.</p>
<p>The main idea is to bring together practitioners, researchers, hobbyists and generally anyone who is interested in recommender systems specifically, or user-oriented data mining generally.</p>

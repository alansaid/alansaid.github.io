excerpt: 'How rate when'
---
<p>I found this pretty interesting <a title="youtube" href="http://youtube-global.blogspot.com/2009/09/five-stars-dominate-ratings.html" target="_blank">blog-post</a> by Youtubes' <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/shivarajaraman" target="_blank">Shiva Rajaraman<em> </em></a> about the distribution of ratings in Youtube videos. Seems almost no people rate videos with anything else than five stars. As soon as I read it I did a similar plot of&nbsp; the Filmtipset dataset I've been working on lately.</p>
<p>It seems that there's quite a difference in the way we rate videos and movies. Below is a plot of the rating distribution in <a title="Filmtipset" href="http://filmtipset.se" target="_blank">Filmtipset</a> and a copy of the one from Youtube. The of the x-axis on both images is 1 to 5.</p>

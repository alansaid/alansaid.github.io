<p>In February I went to the <a title="WSDM 2009" href="http://www.wsdm2009.org/index.php" target="_blank">Second ACM Iternational Conference on Web Search and Data Mining</a> organized at the Yahoo! research center in Barcelona. We had a paper on "<a title="HyPLSA" href="http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1506250.1506255" target="_blank">A hybrid approach to item recommendation in folksonomies</a>" at the <a title="ESAIR 2009" href="http://barcelona.research.yahoo.net/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=esair_2009/" target="_blank">Workshop on Exploiting Semantic Annotations in Information Retrieval</a>.</p>
<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-541"></a>Being my first conference, I was quite happy not to do the presentation and only listening in on the talks. Frankly, I found the workshop day to be better than the two conference days I attended. WSDM is a quite broad conference, thus many of the presentations, although interesting, were somewhat irrelevant for me.</p>
<p>The workshop on the other hand was very rewarding, even thought the topics covered where quite heterogenous, there was a common line through all of the presentations and a very interesting break-out session at the of the workshop.</p>
<p>This being my first conference, I was quite happy when our paper was awarded the price for "Best Technical Paper" at the workshop, sure, it wasn't the main event, but felt quite good anyhow.</p>

<p>Earlier today we got the acceptance notification of our workshop on Context-aware Retrieval and Recommendation which we will be organizing at next years (2011) <a title="IUI2011" href="http://iuiconf.org/" target="_blank">Intelligent User Interfaces (IUI)</a> conference which will be held at Stanford University in February next year.</p>
<p>This workshop is somewhat related to our current one, the <a title="CAMRa2010" href="http://www.dai-labor.de/camra2010/" target="_blank">Challenge on Context-aware Movie Recommendation</a> at this years <a title="RecSys 2010" href="http://recsys.acm.org/2010/" target="_blank">RecSys</a> conference. I've written about the challenge before <a title="CAMRa2010" href="http://alans.se/blog/2010/recsys-2010-workshop/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a title="CAMRa2010" href="http://alans.se/blog/2010/context-aware-movie-recommendation-camra/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-515"></a>This time the topic is a bit more general, not only focusing particular datasets, but rather a more general approach to the context concept.</p>
<p>We're co-organizing the workshop with <a title="B&ouml;hmer" href="https://www.fh-muenster.de/fb2/personen/mitarbeiter/boehmer/index.php" target="_blank">Matthias B&ouml;hmer</a> from TU-M&uuml;nster and <a title="Michahelles" href="http://www.im.ethz.ch/people/fmichahelles" target="_blank">Florian Michahelles</a> from ETHZ who have been working with location based contexts, giving the workshop the needed contextual broadness as we've mostly been working with "abstract" contexts (mood, time, etc).</p>
<p>The questions we're aiming at for the workshop are</p>
<ul>
<li>What is context?</li>
<li> Is context-awareness in retrieval and recommendation necessary?</li>
<li>Which benefits come from context-aware retrieval and recommendation systems?</li>
<li>How do user interfaces handle context?</li>
<li> In what ways can context improve HCI?</li>
<li> How can we combine general- and user-centric context-aware technologies?</li>
<li>How should context affect the way information is presented?</li><br />
</ul><br />
which will hopefully attract authors to submit their work to the workshop.</p>

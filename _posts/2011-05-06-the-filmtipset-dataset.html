<p>I've recently noticed a significant increase in visitors finding they're way here by googling for the filmtipset dataset, so I thought I'd post a descriptive text for those of you looking for it.</p>
<p>Sadly I must inform that the Filmtipset dataset is NOT available for download, nor has it ever been (more or less). Fimtipset have never offered their dataset for download.</p>
<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-797"></a>I did however get in touch with them asking for it and was given an anonymized dump. A subset of this was then subsequently used for one of the tracks at <a title="CAMRa2010" href="http://dai-labor.de/camra2010" target="_blank">CAMRa2010</a> (after getting permission for this from Filmtipset). This dataset was only available during a short time, and only to those who participated in the challenge.</p>
<p>If you're looking for the dataset, your best option is to contact someone at <a title="Filmtipset" href="http://filmtipset.se" target="_blank">Filmtipset</a> directly and ask nicely for it. I do, however, not know whether or not you will be granted it.</p>
<p>Other movie related datasets are evailable elsewhere, the most common being the ones from <a title="Movielens" href="http://movielens.org" target="_blank">movielens</a> offered by <a title="GroupLens" href="http://grouplens.org" target="_blank">GroupLens</a>. There is also the <a title="Netflix Prize" href="http://netflixprize.com" target="_blank">Netflix Prize</a> dataset, which is no longer available for download from the original source, but you will surely find it if you really look for it.</p>
<p>Non-movie related datasets that <a title="DAI Lab" href="http://dai-labor.de/en" target="_blank">we</a> offer are available <a title="Datasets" href="http://www.dai-labor.de/en/competence_centers/irml/datasets/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

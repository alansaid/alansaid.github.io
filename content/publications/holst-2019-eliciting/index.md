abstract: This paper demonstrates how to explore and visualize different types of
  structure in data, including clusters, anomalies, causal relations, and higher order
  relations. The methods are developed with the goal of being as automatic as possible
  and applicable to massive, streaming, and distributed data. Finally, a decentralized
  learning scheme is discussed, enabling finding structure in the data without collecting
  the data centrally.

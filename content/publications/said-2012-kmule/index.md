abstract: Collaborative Filtering Recommender Systems come in a wide variety of variants.
  In this paper we present a system for visualizing and comparing recommendations
  provided by different collaborative recommendation algorithms. The system utilizes
  a set of context-aware, hybrid, and other collaborative filtering solutions in order
  to generate various recommendations from which its users can pick those corresponding
  best to their current situation (i.e. context). All user interaction is fed back
  to the system in order to additionally improve the quality of the recommendations.
  Additionally, users can explicitly ask the system to treat certain recommenders
  as more important than others, or disregard them completely if the list of recommended
  movies is not to their liking.

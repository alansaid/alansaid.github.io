abstract: Context-aware information is widely available in various ways and is becoming
  more and more important for enhancing retrieval performance and recommendation results.
  The current main issue to cope with is not only recommending or retrieving the most
  relevant items and content, but defining them ad hoc. Other relevant issues include
  personalizing and adapting the information and the way it is displayed to the user’s
  current situation and interests. Ubiquitous computing further provides new means
  for capturing user feedback on items and providing information.

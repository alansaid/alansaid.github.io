 abstract = {Context-aware information is widely available in various ways and is becoming more and more important for enhancing retrieval performance and recommendation results. The current main issue to cope with is not only recommending or retrieving the most relevant items and content, but defining them ad hoc. Other relevant issues include personalizing and adapting the information and the way it is displayed to the user’s current situation and interests. Ubiquitous computing further provides new means for capturing user feedback on items and providing information.},

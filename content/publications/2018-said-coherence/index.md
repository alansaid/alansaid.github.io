abstract: Recommender Systems have to deal with a wide variety of users and user types
  that express their preferences in different ways. This difference in user behavior
  can have a profound impact on the performance of the recommender system. Users receive
  better (or worse) recommendations depending on the quantity and the quality of the
  information the system knows about them. Specifically, the inconsistencies in users’
  preferences impose a lower bound on the error the system may achieve when predicting
  ratings for one particular user—this is referred to as the magic barrier. In this
  work, we present a mathematical characterization of the magic barrier based on the
  assumption that user ratings are afflicted with inconsistencies—noise. Furthermore,
  we propose a measure of the consistency of user ratings (rating coherence) that
  predicts the performance of recommendation methods. More specifically, we show that
  user coherence is correlated with the magic barrier; we exploit this correlation
  to discriminate between easy users (those with a lower magic barrier) and difficult
  ones (those with a higher magic barrier). We report experiments where the recommendation
  error for the more coherent users is lower than that of the less coherent ones.
  We further validate these results by using two public datasets, where the necessary
  data to identify the magic barrier is not available, in which we obtain similar
  performance improvements.

abstract: Recommender systems are crucial components of most commercial web sites
  to keep users satisfied and to increase revenue. Thus, a lot of effort is made to
  improve recommendation accuracy. But when is the best possible performance of the
  recommender reached? The magic barrier, refers to some unknown level of prediction
  accuracy a recommender system can attain. The magic barrier reveals whether there
  is still room for improving prediction accuracy, or indicates that any further improvement
  is meaningless. In this work, we present a mathematical characterization of the
  magic barrier based on the assumption that user ratings are afflicted with inconsistencies
  - noise. In a case study with a commercial movie recommender, we investigate the
  inconsistencies of the user ratings and estimate the magic barrier in order to assess
  the actual quality of the recommender system.

abstract: People increasingly use the Internet for obtaining information regarding
  diseases, diagnoses and available treatments. Currently, many online health portals
  already provide non-personalized health information in the form of articles. However,
  it can be challenging to find information relevant to one's condition, interpret
  this in context, and understand the medical terms and relationships. Recommender
  Systems (RS) already help these systems perform precise information filtering. In
  this short paper, we look one step ahead and show the progress made towards RS helping
  users find personalized, complex medical interventions or support them with preventive
  healthcare measures. We identify key challenges that need to be addressed for RS
  to offer the kind of decision support needed in high-risk domains like healthcare.

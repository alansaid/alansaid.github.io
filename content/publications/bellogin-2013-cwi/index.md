abstract: This paper provides an overview of the work done at the Centrum Wiskunde
  & Informatica (CWI) and Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) for different
  tracks of TREC 2013. We participated in the Contextual Suggestion Track, the Federated
  Web Search Track, the Knowledge Base Acceleration (KBA) Track, and the Web Ad-hoc
  Track. In the Contextual Suggestion track, we focused on filtering the entire ClueWeb12
  collection to generate recommendations according to the provided user profiles and
  contexts. For the Federated Web Search track, we exploited both categories from
  ODP and document relevance to merge result lists. In the KBA track, we focused on
  the Cumulative Citation Recommendation task where we exploited different features
  to two classification algorithms. For the Web track, we extended an ad-hoc baseline
  with a proximity model that promotes documents in which the query terms are positioned
  closer together.

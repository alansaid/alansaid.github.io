abstract: "Recommender systems research is by and large based on comparisons of recommendation
  algorithms' predictive accuracies: the better the evaluation metrics (higher accuracy
  scores or lower predictive errors), the better the recommendation algorithm. Comparing
  the evaluation results of two recommendation approaches is however a difficult process
  as there are very many factors to be considered in the implementation of an algorithm,
  its evaluation, and how datasets are processed and prepared. This tutorial shows
  how to present evaluation results in a clear and concise manner, while ensuring
  that the results are comparable, replicable and unbiased. These insights are not
  limited to recommender systems research alone, but are also valid for experiments
  with other types of personalized interactions and contextual information access."

abstract: On today’s World Wide Web, social recommender systems have become a commodity
  regardless of application domain. Even tangible items such as food and clothes have
  become social. Together with a seemingly endless amount of personalization and recommender
  systems ranging from movies, music, or consumer products, recipe recommender systems
  are attracting many users looking for inspiration on the next thing to purchase
  or cook. There is however a conceptual difference between recommending consumer
  goods for leisure and entertainment, and recommending food. What people eat has
  a direct effect on their health, an aspect commonly overlooked in the context of
  recommendation. In this work, we present an early analysis of users’ interactions
  with recipes (ratings) on the online social network Allrecipes.com. We compare the
  interaction patterns of users from locations known to have poor health to users
  from locations known to have good health in order to identify whether there is an
  observable difference between the two populations. Our results point to a statistically
  significant difference between the healthy and unhealthy groups, a difference that
  could potentially be used to create health-conscious, personalized, recommendation
  services to aid people in their daily lives.

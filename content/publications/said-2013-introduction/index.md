abstract: 'The challenge and workshop on Context-Aware Movie Recommendation (CAMRa2010)
  were conducted jointly in 2010 with the Recommender Systems conference. The challenge
  focused on three context-aware recommendation scenarios: time-based, mood-based,
  and social recommendation. The participants were provided with anonymized datasets
  from two real-world online movie recommendation communities and competed against
  each other for obtaining the highest accuracy of recommendations. The datasets contained
  contextual features, such as tags, annotation, social relationsips, and comments,
  normally not available in public recommendation datasets. More than 40 teams from
  21 countries participated in the challenge. Their participation was summarized by
  10 papers published by the workshop, which have been extended and revised for this
  special section. In this preface we overview the challenge datasets, tasks, evaluation
  metrics, and the obtained outcomes. Â© 2013 ACM.'

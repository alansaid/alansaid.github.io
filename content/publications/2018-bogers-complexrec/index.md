abstract: "Over the past decade, recommendation algorithms for ratings prediction
  and item ranking have steadily matured. However, these state-of-the-art algorithms
  are typically applied in relatively straightforward scenarios. In reality, recommendation
  is often a more complex problem: it is usually just a single step in the user's
  more complex background need. These background needs can often place a variety of
  constraints on which recommendations are interesting to the user and when they are
  appropriate. However, relatively little research has been done on these complex
  recommendation scenarios. The ComplexRec 2018 workshop addresses this by providing
  an interactive venue for discussing approaches to recommendation in complex scenarios
  that have no simple one-size-fits-all solution."

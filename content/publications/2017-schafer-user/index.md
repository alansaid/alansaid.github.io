abstract: In order to use and model nutritional knowledge in a food recommender system,
  uncertainties regarding the users nutritional state and thus the personal health
  value of food items, as well as conflicting nutritional theories need to be quantified,
  qualified and subsumed into falsifiable models. In this paper, we reflect on different
  error sources with respect to nutrition and consider how such issues can be tackled
  in future systems. We discuss the integration of general nutritional theories into
  information systems as well as user specific nutritional measures and different
  approaches to evaluating the utility of a given nutritional model.

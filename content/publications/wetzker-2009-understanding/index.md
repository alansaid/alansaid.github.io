abstract: This paper describes our approach to the challenge of graph-based tag recommendation
  in social bookmarking services. Along the ECML PKDD 2009 Discovery Challenge, we
  design a tag recommender that accurately predicts the tagging behavior of users
  within the Bibsonomy bookmarking service. We find that the tagging vocabularies
  among folksonomy users differ radically due to multilingual aspects as well as heterogeneous
  tagging habits. Our model overcomes the prediction problem resulting from these
  heterogeneities by translating user vocabularies, so called personomies, to the
  global folksonomy vocabulary and vice versa. Furthermore we combine our user-centric
  translation approach with item-centric methods to achieve more accurate solutions.
  Since our method is purely graph-based, it can also readily be applied to other
  folksonomies.

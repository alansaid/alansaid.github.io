abstract: 'This report documents the program and the outcomes of Dagstuhl Seminar
  23031 \"Frontiers of Information Access Experimentation for Research and Education\",
  which brought together 38 participants from 12 countries. The seminar addressed
  technology-enhanced information access (information retrieval, recommender systems,
  natural language processing) and specifically focused on developing more responsible
  experimental practices leading to more valid results, both for research as well
  as for scientific education. The seminar featured a series of long and short talks
  delivered by participants, who helped in setting a common ground and in letting
  emerge topics of interest to be explored as the main output of the seminar. This
  led to the definition of five groups which investigated challenges, opportunities,
  and next steps in the following areas: reality check, i.e. conducting real-world
  studies, human-machine-collaborative relevance judgment frameworks, overcoming methodological
  challenges in information retrieval and recommender systems through awareness and
  education, results-blind reviewing, and guidance for authors. Date: 15--20 January
  2023. Website: https://www.dagstuhl.de/23031.'

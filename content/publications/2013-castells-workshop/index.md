abstract: Evaluating adaptive and personalized information retrieval tech-niques is
  known to be a difficult endeavor. The rapid evolution of novel technologies in this
  scope raises additional challenges that further stress the need for new evaluation
  approaches and method-ologies. The BARS 2013 workshop seeks to provide a specific
  venue for work on novel, personalization-centric benchmarking approaches to evaluate
  adaptive retrieval and recommender systems.

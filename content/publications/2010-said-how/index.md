abstract: In this paper we present an analysis of the social movie recommendation
  community Filmtipset. Filmtipset is Sweden's largest movie recommendation community
  with more than 80,000 users. The website offers movie recommendations based on usage
  data, but also consists of a social network where users are able to befriend one
  another. All content is user-generated and there is a multitude of features that
  make the dataset stand out among other movie recommendation datasets. We evaluate
  the social graphs' impact on users similarities in taste in movies, and show that
  utilizing this relation could be used to improve movie recommendation quality.

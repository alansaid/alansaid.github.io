abstract: Recommender systems attempt to ﬁnd relevant data for their users. As the
  body of data available in the Web sphere becomes larger, this task becomes increasingly
  harder. In this paper we present a comparison of recommendation results when using
  different social and pseudo-social features commonly available in online movie recommendation
  communities. Social relations, whether inferred or not, hold implicit information
  about users’ taste and interests. We present results of a simple method that extends
  standard collaborative ﬁltering algorithms to include a social network and show
  that this explicit and implicit information (i.e. direct friendship, and indirect
  co-commenting etc.) can be used to improve the quality of recommendations.

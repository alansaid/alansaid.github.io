abstract: The first Workshop on Engendering Health with Recom- mender Systems was
  organized in conjunction with ACM RecSys 2016. The focus of the workshop was on
  bringing together researchers and practitioners from diverse areas of health, well-being,
  decision support, and behavioral change. Health-related issues in recommender systems
  have been a growing research topic in the recent years and this was a ini- tial
  attempt at bringing together academics and practition- ers to share their experiences
  on working on related issues.

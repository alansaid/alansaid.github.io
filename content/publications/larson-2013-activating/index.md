abstract: Recommender systems have always faced the problem of sparse data. In the
  current era, however, with its demand for highly personalized, real-time, context-aware
  recommendation, the sparse data problem only threatens to grow worse. Crowd-sourcing,
  specifically, outsourcing micro-requests for information to the crowd, opens new
  possibilities to fight the sparse data challenge. In this paper, we lay out a vision
  for recommender systems that, instead of consulting an external crowd, rely on their
  own user base to actively supply the rich information needed to improve recommendations.
  We propose that recommender systems should create and exploit reciprocity between
  users and items. Specifically, recommender systems should not only recommend items
  for users (who would like to watch or buy them), but also recommend users for items
  (that need additional information in order that they can be better recommended by
  the system). Reciprocal recommendations provide a gentle incentivization that can
  be deployed non-invasively, yet is powerful enough to promote a productive symbiosis
  between users and items. By exploiting reciprocity, recommender systems can “look
  inwards” and activate their own user base to contribute the information needed to
  improve recommendations for the entire user community.

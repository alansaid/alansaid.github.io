abstract: The 2014 ACM Recommender Systems Challenge invited re- searchers and practitioners
  to work towards a common goal, this goal being the prediction of users engagement
  in movie ratings expressed on Twitter. More than 200 participants sought to join
  the challenge and work on the new dataset released in its scope. The participants
  were asked to de- velop new algorithms to predict user engagement and evalu- ate
  them in a common setting, ensuring that the comparison was objective and unbiased,
  within the challenge.

abstract: We describe the Universal Recommender, a recommender system for semantic
  datasets that generalizes domain-specific recommenders such as content-based, collaborative,
  social, bibliographic, lexicographic, hybrid and other recommenders. In contrast
  to existing recommender systems, the Universal Recommender applies to any dataset
  that allows a semantic representation. We describe the scalable three-stage architecture
  of the Universal Recommender and its application to Internet Protocol Television
  (IPTV). To achieve good recommendation accuracy, several novel machine learning
  and optimization problems are identified. We finally give a brief argument supporting
  the need for machine learning recommenders.

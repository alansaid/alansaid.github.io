abstract: Context-awareness for information retrieval is a challenging problem as
  information about the user's current situation is rarely available. However, if
  such information is available, retrieval and recommendation systems could use it
  to find information more relevant to their users' current context. We present a
  model for creating contextualized recommendations based on implicitly expressed
  context via keywords assigned to previously seen items and other available information.
  When employed, the model can create ad hoc recommendation with improved accuracy.

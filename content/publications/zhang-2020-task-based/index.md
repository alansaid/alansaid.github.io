abstract: Color coding is a fundamental technique for mapping data to visual representations,
  allowing people to carry out comprehension-based tasks. Process tomography is a
  rapidly developing non-invasive imaging technique used in various ﬁelds of science
  due to its effective ﬂow monitoring and data acquisition [KŁS∗19]. To study how
  well colormaps can support visual comprehension of tomographic data, we conduct
  a feasibility evaluation of 11 widely-used color schemes. We employ the same segmentation
  tasks characterized by Microwave Tomography (MWT) on each individual chosen colormap,
  and then conduct a quantitative assessment of those schemes. Based on the insight
  gained, we conclude that autumn, viridis, and parula colormaps yield the best segmentation
  results. According to our ﬁndings, we propose a colormap design guideline for practitioners
  and researchers in the ﬁeld of process tomography.

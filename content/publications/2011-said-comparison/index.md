abstract: Recommender systems attempt to find relevant data for their users. As the
  amount of data available in the Web becomes larger, this task becomes increasingly
  harder. In this paper we present a comparison of recommendation results when using
  different demographic features (age, location, gender, etc.) commonly available
  in online movie recommendation communities. We assume that demographic information
  holds implicit information about users' taste and interests, and present results
  of a simple method that extends standard collaborative filtering algorithms to include
  one or several of these features. We evaluate the our assumption in movie recommendation
  scenario and combine different features in order to improve recommendation results.

abstract: This work presents the recommendation algorithms deployed by the winning
  team (recomenders.net) in the ACM RecSys 2013 News Recommender Systems Challenge
  which ran during September 2013. The paper introduces concepts related to the challenge,
  an overview of the challenges related to news article recommendation and the differences
  to other recommendation domains, e.g. music, movies, etc. as well as gives a brief
  overview of the Open Recommendation Protocol (ORP) infrastructure used for the challenge.
  Furthermore, the paper presents the recommendation framework and the algorithms
  implemented by the recommenders.net team in the challenge. Finally, the paper presents
  the results obtained by the team and discusses the metrics used to crown the winners
  of the challenge.

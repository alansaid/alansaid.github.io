abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of item recommendation in collaborative
  tagging communities, so called folksonomies, where users annotate interesting items
  with tags. Rather than following a collaborative filtering or annotation-based approach
  to recommendation, we extend the probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) approach
  and present a unified recommendation model which evolves from item user and item
  tag co-occurrences in parallel. The inclusion of tags reduces known collaborative
  filtering problems related to overfitting and allows for higher quality recommendations.
  Experimental results on a large snapshot of the delicious bookmarking service show
  the scalability of our approach and an improved recommendation quality compared
  to two-mode collaborative or annotation based methods.

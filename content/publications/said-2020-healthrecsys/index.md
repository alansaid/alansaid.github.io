abstract: HealthRecSys 2020 was the 5th International Workshop on Health Recommender
  Systems held in conjunction with the 14th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems.
  This workshop followed the previous workshop in 2019 [4] and focused on the application
  and potentials of recommender systems on health promotion, health care, and health-related
  topics. By engaging in the discussion and representation of health domains into
  recommender systems, this workshop facilitated the cross-domain collaborations and
  exchange of knowledge and infrastructure. This year, in particular, COVID-19-related
  contributions were discussed.

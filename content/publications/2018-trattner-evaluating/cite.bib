 abstract = {In the previous chapters, we have learned how to design group recommender systems but did not explicitly discuss how to evaluate them. The evaluation techniques for group recommender systems are often the same or similar to those that are used for single user recommenders. We show how to apply these techniques on the basis of examples and introduce evaluation approaches that are specifically useful in group recommendation scenarios.},

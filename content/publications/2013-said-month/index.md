abstract: During the last decade, recommender systems have become a ubiquitous feature
  in the online world. Research on systems and algorithms in this area has flourished,
  leading to novel techniques for personalization and recommendation. The evaluation
  of recommender systems, however, has not seen similar progress---techniques have
  changed little since the advent of recommender systems, when evaluation methodologies
  were \"borrowed\" from related research areas. As an effort to move evaluation methodology
  forward, this paper describes a production recommender system infrastructure that
  allows research systems to be evaluated in situ, by real-world metrics such as user
  clickthrough. We present an analysis of one month of interactions with this infrastructure
  and share our findings.

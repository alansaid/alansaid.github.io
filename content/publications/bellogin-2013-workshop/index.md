abstract: Experiment replication and reproduction are key requirements for empirical
  research methodology, and an important open issue in the field of Recommender Systems.
  When an experiment is repeated by a different researcher and exactly the same result
  is obtained, we can say the experiment has been replicated. When the results are
  not exactly the same but the conclusions are compatible with the prior ones, we
  have a reproduction of the experiment. Reproducibility and replication involve recommendation
  algorithm implementations, experimental protocols, and evaluation metrics. While
  the problem of reproducibility and replication has been recognized in the Recommender
  Systems community, the need for a clear solution remains largely unmet, which motivates
  the present workshop.

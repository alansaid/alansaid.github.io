abstract: Context-aware recommender systems are becoming a popular topic, still, there
  are many untouched aspects. In this paper, research involving context identification
  and the concepts related to hybrid and context-aware systems is presented. A conceptual
  architecture for a context-aware recommender system for movies and TV shows is furthermore
  introduced. The system consists of a number of processes for context identification
  and recommendation. Key contextual features are identified and used for the creation
  of several sets of recommendations, based on the predicted context. The main focus
  of the research presented here is the identification of context, which in turn is
  used for recommendation. The results will be evaluated and incorporated into the
  recommendation engine of movie and TV recommendation website Moviepilot.

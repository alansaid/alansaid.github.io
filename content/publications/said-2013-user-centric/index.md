abstract: Collaborative filtering recommender systems often use nearest neighbor methods
  to identify candidate items. In this paper we present an inverted neighborhood model,
  k-Furthest Neighbors, to identify less ordinary neighborhoods for the purpose of
  creating more diverse recommendations. The approach is evaluated two-fold, once
  in a traditional information retrieval evaluation setting where the model is trained
  and validated on a split train/test set, and once through an online user study (N=132)
  to identify users' perceived quality of the recommender. A standard k-nearest neighbor
  recommender is used as a baseline in both evaluation settings. Our evaluation shows
  that even though the proposed furthest neighbor model is outperformed in the traditional
  evaluation setting, the perceived usefulness of the algorithm shows no significant
  difference in the results of the user study.

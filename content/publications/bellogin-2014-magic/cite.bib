 abstract = {Recommender Systems need to deal with different types of users who represent their preferences in various ways. This difference in user behaviour has a deep impact on the final performance of the recommender system, where some users may receive either better or worse recommendations depending, mostly, on the quantity and the quality of the information the system knows about the user. Specifically, the inconsistencies of the user impose a lower bound on the error the system may achieve when predicting ratings for that particular user.},

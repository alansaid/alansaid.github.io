abstract: Recommender Systems need to deal with different types of users who represent
  their preferences in various ways. This difference in user behaviour has a deep
  impact on the final performance of the recommender system, where some users may
  receive either better or worse recommendations depending, mostly, on the quantity
  and the quality of the information the system knows about the user. Specifically,
  the inconsistencies of the user impose a lower bound on the error the system may
  achieve when predicting ratings for that particular user.

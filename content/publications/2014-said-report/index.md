abstract: Context-aware information is widely available in various ways and is becoming
  more and more important for enhancing retrieval performance and recommendation results.
  The current main issue to cope with is not only recommending or retrieving the most
  relevant items and content, but defining them ad hoc. Other relevant issues include
  personalizing and adapting the information and the way it is displayed to the user's
  current situation and interests. The workshop on Context-awareness in Retrieval
  and Recommendation is a forum for research on context-awareness in information retrieval,
  recommender systems and human computer interaction. The fourth iteration of the
  workshop was organized in conjunction to the 36th European Conference on Information
  Retrieval in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

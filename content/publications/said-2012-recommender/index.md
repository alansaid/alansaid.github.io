abstract: Recommender systems add value to vast content resources by matching users
  with items of interest. In recent years, immense progress has been made in recommendation
  tech- niques. The evaluation of these has however not been matched and is threatening
  to impede the further development of rec-ommender systems. In this paper we propose
  an approach that addresses this impasse by formulating a novel evalua-tion concept
  adopting aspects from recommender systems research and industry. Our model can express
  the quality of a recommender algorithm from three perspectives, the end consumer
  (user), the service provider and the vendor (business and technique for both). We
  review current bench- marking activities and point out their shortcomings, which
  are addressed by our model. We also explain how our 3D benchmarking framework would
  apply to a specific use case.

abstract: Recommender systems have been put to use in the entertainment and e-commerce
  domains for decades, and in these decades, recommender systems have grown and matured
  into reliable and ubiquitous systems in todayâ€™s digital landscape. Relying on this
  maturity, the application of recommender systems for health and well-being has seen
  a rise in recent years, paving the way for tailored and personalized systems that
  support caretakers, caregivers, and other users in the health domain. In this introduction,
  we give a brief overview of the stakes, the requirements, and the possibilities
  that recommender systems for health and well-being bring.

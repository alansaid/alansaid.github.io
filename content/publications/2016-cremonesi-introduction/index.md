abstract: Recommender systems addvalue to vast content resources by matching users
  with items of interest. In recent years, immense progress has been made in recommendation
  techniques. The evaluation of these systems is still based on traditional information
  retrieval and statistics metrics (e.g., precision, recall, RMSE), often not taking
  the use case and situation of the system into consideration. However, the rapid
  evolution of recommender systems in both their goals and their application domains
  fosters the need for new evaluation methodologies and environments. This special
  issue serves as a venue for work on novel, recommendation-centric benchmarking approaches
  taking the usersâ€™ utility, the business values, and the technical constraints into
  consideration.

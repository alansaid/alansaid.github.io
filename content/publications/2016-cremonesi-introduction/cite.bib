 abstract = {Recommender systems addvalue to vast content resources by matching users with
items of interest. In recent years, immense progress has been made in recommendation
techniques. The evaluation of these systems is still based on traditional information
retrieval and statistics metrics (e.g., precision, recall, RMSE), often not taking the use
case and situation of the system into consideration. However, the rapid evolution of
recommender systems in both their goals and their application domains fosters the
need for new evaluation methodologies and environments. This special issue serves as
a venue for work on novel, recommendation-centric benchmarking approaches taking
the usersâ€™ utility, the business values, and the technical constraints into consideration.},

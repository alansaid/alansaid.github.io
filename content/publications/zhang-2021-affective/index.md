abstract: The design of colormaps can help tomography operators obtain accurate visual
  comprehension, thereby assisting safety-critical decisions. The research presented
  here is about deploying colormaps that promote the best affective responses for
  industrial microwave tomography (MWT). To answer the two research questions related
  to our study, we firstly conducted a quantitative analysis of 11 frequently-used
  colormaps on a segmentation task. Secondly, we presented the same colormaps within
  a crowdsourced study comprising two parts to verify the quantitative outcomes. The
  first part encoded affective responses from participants into a prevailing four-quadrant
  valence–arousal grid; the second part recorded participant ratings towards the accuracy
  of each colormap on MWT segmentation. We concluded that three colormaps are the
  best suited in the context of MWT tasks. We also found that the colormaps triggering
  emotions in the positive–exciting quadrant can facilitate more accurate visual comprehension
  than other affect-related quadrants. A synthetic colormap design guideline was consequently
  proposed.

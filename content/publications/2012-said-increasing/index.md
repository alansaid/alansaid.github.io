abstract: One of the current challenges concerning improving recommender systems consists
  of ﬁnding ways of increasing serendipity and diversity, without compromising the
  precision and recall of the system. One possible way to approach this problem is
  to complement a standard recommender by another recommender “orthogonal” to the
  standard one, i.e. one that recommends diﬀerent items than the standard. In this
  paper we investigate to which extent an inverted nearest neighbor model, k-furthest
  neighbor, is suitable for complementing a traditional kNN recommender. We compare
  the recommendations obtained when recommending items disliked by people least similar
  to oneself to those obtained by recommending items liked by those most similar to
  oneself. Our experiments show that the proposed furthest neighbor method provides
  more diverse recommendations with a tolerable loss in precision in comparison to
  traditional nearest neighbor methods. The recommendations obtained by kfurthest
  neighbor-based approaches are almost completely orthogonal to those obtained by
  their k-nearest neighborsbased counterparts.

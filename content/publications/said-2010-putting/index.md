abstract: 'The Challenge on Context-Aware Movie Recommendation (CAMRa) was conducted
  as part of a join event on Context-Awareness in Recommender Systems at the 2010
  ACM Recommender Systems conference. The challenge focused on three context-aware
  recommendation tasks: time-based, mood-based, and social recommendation. The participants
  were provided with anonymized datasets from two real world online movie recommendation
  communities and competed against each other for obtaining the highest recommendation
  accuracy for each task. The datasets contained contextual features, such as mood,
  plot annotation, social network, and comments, normally not available in movie recommendation
  datasets. Over 40 teams from 20 countries participated in the challenge. Their participation
  was summarized by 10 papers accepted to the CAMRa workshop.'

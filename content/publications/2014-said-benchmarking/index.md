abstract: This chapter describes the concepts involved in the process of benchmarking
  of recommendation systems. Benchmarking of recommendation systems is used to ensure
  the quality of a research system or production system in comparison to other systems,
  whether algorithmically, infrastructurally, or according to any sought-after quality.
  Specifically, the chapter presents evaluation of recommendation systems according
  to recommendation accuracy, technical constraints, and business values in the context
  of a multi-dimensional benchmarking and evaluation model encompassing any number
  of qualities into a final comparable metric. The focus is put on quality measures
  related to recommendation accuracy, technical factors, and business values. The
  chapter first introduces concepts related to evaluation and benchmarking of recommendation
  systems, continues with an overview of the current state of the art, then presents
  the multi-dimensional approach in detail. The chapter concludes with a brief discussion
  of the introduced concepts and a summary.

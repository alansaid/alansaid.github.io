 abstract = {This chapter describes the concepts involved in the process of benchmarking of recommendation systems. Benchmarking of recommendation systems is used to ensure the quality of a research system or production system in comparison to other systems, whether algorithmically, infrastructurally, or according to any sought-after quality. Specifically, the chapter presents evaluation of recommendation systems according to recommendation accuracy, technical constraints, and business values in the context of a multi-dimensional benchmarking and evaluation model encompassing any number of qualities into a final comparable metric. The focus is put on quality measures related to recommendation accuracy, technical factors, and business values. The chapter first introduces concepts related to evaluation and benchmarking of recommendation systems, continues with an overview of the current state of the art, then presents the multi-dimensional approach in detail. The chapter concludes with a brief discussion of the introduced concepts and a summary.},

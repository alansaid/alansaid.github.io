abstract: 'Information retrieval and recommender systems are deployed in real world
  environments. Therefore, to get a real feeling for the system, we should study their
  characteristics in “real world studies”. This raises the question: What does it
  mean for a study to be realistic? Does it mean the user has to be a real user of
  the system or can anyone participate in a study of the system? Does it mean the
  system needs to be perceived as realistic by the user? Does it mean the manipulations
  need to be perceived as realistic by the user?'

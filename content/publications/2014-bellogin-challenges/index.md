abstract: The TREC 2013 Contextual Suggestion Track allowed participants to submit
  personalised rankings using documents either from the OpenWeb or from an archived,
  static Web collection, the ClueWeb12 dataset. We argue that this setting poses problems
  in how the performance of the participants should be compared. We analyse biases
  found in the process, both objective and subjective, and discuss these issues in
  the general framework of evaluating personalised Information Retrieval using dynamic
  against static datasets.

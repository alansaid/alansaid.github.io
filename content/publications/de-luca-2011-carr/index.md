abstract: Context-aware information is widely available in various ways such as interaction
  patterns, location, devices, annotations, query suggestions and user profiles and
  is becoming more and more important for enhancing retrieval performance and recommendation
  results. At the moment, the main issue to cope with is not only recommending or
  retrieving the most relevant items and content, but defining them ad hoc. Other
  relevant issues are personalizing and adapting the information and the way it is
  displayed to the user's current situation (device, location) and interests.

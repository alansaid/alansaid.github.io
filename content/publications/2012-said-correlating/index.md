abstract: Research on recommender systems evaluation generally measures the quality
  of the algorithm, or system, offline, i.e. based on some information retrieval metric,
  e.g. precision or recall. The metrics do however not always reflect the users' perceptions
  of the recommendations. Perception-related values are instead often measured through
  user studies, however the bulk of the work on recommender systems is evaluated through
  offline analysis. In the work presented in this paper we choose to neglect the quality
  of the recom-mender system and instead focus on the similarity of aspects related
  to users' perception of recommender systems. Based on a user study (N = 132) we
  show the correlation of concepts such as usefulness, ratings, obviousness, and serendipity
  from the users' perspectives. Copyright Â© 2012 ACM.

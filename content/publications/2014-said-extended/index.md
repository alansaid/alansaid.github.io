abstract: Current de facto data model standards in the recommender systems field do
  not support easy encoding of heterogeneous data aspects such as context, content,
  social ties, etc. In order to facilitate a simpler means of sharing and using the
  rich datasets used by research-as well as production systems today, in this paper
  we propose a data model standard for heterogeneous datasets in the recommender systems
  domain. The data model is based on the classical tab separated value (TSV) data
  model with additional fields for encoding relational data in JSON format. Through
  using already established data sharing formats, we intend to make the usage of the
  data model as effortless as possible, i.e. there already exist generic tools for
  parsing and managing the data format in most programming languages. We invite the
  RecSys community to contribute to the proposed data model in order to increase ease
  of use and adoption.

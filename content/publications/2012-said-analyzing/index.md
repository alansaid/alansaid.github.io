abstract: Collaborative filtering recommender systems provide their users with relevant
  items based on information from other similar users. Popular collaborative filtering
  approaches such as Pearson correlation coefficient and cosine similarity, compute
  the similarity between users based on the set of their co-rated items. However,
  similarities are commonly computed without taking the popularity of the set of two
  users' co-rated items into consideration, e.g. an item rated by very many users
  should have less impact on the similarity measure, and analogously an item rated
  by few should have a larger impact on the similarity score of two users. In this
  paper, we investigate the effects of common weighting schemes on different types
  of users, i.e. new users with few ratings (so-called cold start users), post cold
  start users, and power users. Empirical studies over two datasets have shown in
  which of these cases weighting schemes are beneficial in terms of recommendation
  quality. Â© 2012 ACM.

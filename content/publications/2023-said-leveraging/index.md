abstract: We present a proof of concept application for interactive recommendations
  and explanations leveraging the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). The
  application creates a highly interactive user-driven setting for recommendations
  giving users the possibility to explicitly tailor recommendations to their needs.
  Using the possibilities brought by LLMs, the application further generates convincing
  explanations of recommendations, aligned with the explicitly stated goals of the
  users. The web application continuously improves by incorporating user feedback
  and updating recommendations and explanations as needed.

 abstract = {Recommender Systems need to deal with diﬀerent types of users who represent their preferences in various ways. This diﬀerence in user behaviour has a deep impact on the accuracy of the recommendations received by the users, depending, mostly, on the quantity and the quality of the information the system knows about the user. Speciﬁcally, the inconsistencies of the user impose a lower bound on the error the system may achieve when predicting ratings for that particular user [3].},

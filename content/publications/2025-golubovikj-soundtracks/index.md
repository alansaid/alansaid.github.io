abstract: "The majority of research in recommender systems, be it algorithmic improvements, context-awareness, explainability, or other areas, evaluates these systems on datasets that capture user interaction over a relatively limited time span. However, recommender systems can very well be used continuously for extended time. Similarly so, user behavior may evolve over that extended time. Although media studies and psychology offer a wealth of research on the evolution of user preferences and behavior as individuals age, there has been scant research in this regard within the realm of user modeling and recommender systems. In this study, we investigate the evolution of user preferences and behavior using the LFM-2b dataset, which, to our knowledge, is the only dataset that encompasses a sufficiently extensive time frame to permit real longitudinal studies and includes age information about its users. We identify specific usage and taste preferences directly related to the age of the user, i.e., while younger users tend to listen broadly to contemporary popular music, older users have more elaborate and personalized listening habits. 
The findings yield important insights that open new directions for research in recommender systems, providing guidance for future efforts."

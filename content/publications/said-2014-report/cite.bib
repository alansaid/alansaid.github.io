 abstract = {Context-aware information is widely available in various ways and is becoming more and more important for enhancing retrieval performance and recommendation results. The current main issue to cope with is not only recommending or retrieving the most relevant items and content, but defining them ad hoc. Other relevant issues include personalizing and adapting the information and the way it is displayed to the user's current situation and interests. The workshop on Context-awareness in Retrieval and Recommendation is a forum for research on context-awareness in information retrieval, recommender systems and human computer interaction. The fourth iteration of the workshop was organized in conjunction to the 36th European Conference on Information Retrieval in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.},

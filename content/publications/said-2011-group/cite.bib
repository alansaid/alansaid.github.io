 abstract = {The 2011 Challenge on Context-Aware Movie Recommendation (CAMRa2011) was held in conjunction with the Fifth ACM Conference on Recommender Systems (RecSys2011). The challenge focused on group-based recommendation for households, as well as identification of household members who had rated specific movies. The participants were provided with anonymized datasets from a real world online movie recommendation community and competed against each other for obtaining the highest recommendation accuracy. Over 45 teams from 23 countries participated in the challenge. Their participation was summarized by the nine papers accepted to the CAMRa2011 workshop. This paper presents an overview of the tracks and datasets of CAMRa2011. Â© 2011 ACM.},

abstract: Traditional recommender system evaluation focuses on raising the accuracy,
  or lowering the rating prediction error of the recommendation algorithm. Recently,
  however, discrepancies between commonly used metrics (e.g. precision, recall, root-mean-square
  error) and the experienced quality from the users' have been brought to light. This
  project aims to address these discrepancies by attempting to develop novel means
  of recommender systems evaluation which encompasses qualities identified through
  traditional evaluation metrics and user-centric factors, e.g. diversity, serendipity,
  novelty, etc., as well as bringing further insights in the topic by analyzing and
  translating the problem of evaluation from an Information Retrieval perspective.

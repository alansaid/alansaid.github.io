abstract: The evaluation of RSs has been, and still is, the object of active research
  in the field. Since the advent of the first RS, recommendation performance has been
  usually equated to the accuracy of rating prediction, that is, estimated ratings
  are compared against actual ratings, and differences between them are computed by
  means of the MAE and RMSE metrics. In terms of the effective utility of recommendations
  for users, there is, however, an increasing realization that the quality (precision)
  of a ranking of recommended items can be more important than the accuracy in predicting
  specific rating values. As a result, precision-oriented metrics are being increasingly
  considered in the field, and a large amount of recent work has focused on evaluating
  top-N ranked recommendation lists with the above type of metrics.

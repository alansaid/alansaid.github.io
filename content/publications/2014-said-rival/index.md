abstract: 'Currently, it is diffcult to put in context and compare the results from
  a given evaluation of a recommender system, mainly because too many alternatives
  exist when design- ing and implementing an evaluation strategy. Furthermore, the
  actual implementation of a recommendation algorithm sometimes diverges considerably
  from the well-known ideal formulation due to manual tuning and modifications observed
  to work better in some situations. RiVal - a recommender system evaluation toolkit
  - allows for complete control of the different evaluation dimensions that take place
  in any experimental evaluation of a recommender system: data split- ting, definition
  of evaluation strategies, and computation of evaluation metrics. In this demo we
  present some of the functionality of RiVal and show step-by-step how RiVal can be
  used to evaluate the results from any recommendation framework and make sure that
  the results are comparable and reproducible.'

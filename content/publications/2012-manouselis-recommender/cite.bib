 abstract = {The Recommender System Challenge 2012 invited participants to work on two tracks with real-world datasets and to submit their contributions that would be related to specific problem contexts. First of all, it asked participants to develop new algorithms and to compare them to other algorithms in given settings; in addition, it asked participants to explore with new recommendation methods, services, as well as added-value services related to recommendation.

abstract: We present a study of how recommendations are received in real life by users
  across different news domains (traditional online newspapers, hobbyist websites,
  forums, etc.). Our analysis shows that readers of websites centered around specific
  topics are generally less likely to interact with recommendations than readers of
  traditional news websites.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.

abstract: 'As global warming soars, the need to assess and reduce the environmental impact of recommender systems is becoming increasingly urgent. Despite this, the recommender systems community hardly understands, addresses, and evaluates the environmental impact of their work. In this study, we examine the environmental impact of recommender systems research by reproducing typical experimental pipelines. Based on our results, we provide guidelines for researchers and practitioners on how to minimize the environmental footprint of their work and implement green recommender systems — recommender systems designed to minimize their energy consumption and carbon footprint. Our analysis covers 79 papers from the 2013 and 2023 ACM RecSys conferences, comparing traditional “good old-fashioned AI” models with modern deep learning models. We designed and reproduced representative experimental pipelines for both years, measuring energy consumption using a hardware energy meter and converting it into CO2 equivalents. Our results show that papers utilizing deep learning models emit approximately 42 times more CO2 equivalents than papers using traditional models. On average, a single deep learning-based paper generates 2,909 kilograms of CO2 equivalents — more than the carbon emissions of a person flying from New York City to Melbourne or the amount of CO2 sequestered by one tree over 260 years. This work underscores the urgent need for the recommender systems and wider machine learning communities to adopt green AI principles, balancing algorithmic advancements and environmental responsibility to build a sustainable future with AI-powered personalization.'

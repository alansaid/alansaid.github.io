abstract: Recommender System Challenges such as the Netix Prize, KDD Cup, etc. have
  contributed vastly to the development and adoptability of recommender systems. Each
  year a number of challenges or contests are organized covering different aspects
  of recommendation. In this tutorial and panel, we present some of the factors involved
  in successfully organizing a challenge, whether for reasons purely related to research,
  industrial challenges, or to widen the scope of recommender systems applications.

abstract: The advantage of Factorization Machines over other factorization models
  is their ability to easily integrate and efficiently exploit auxiliary information
  to improve Collaborative Filtering. Until now, this auxiliary information has been
  drawn from external knowledge sources beyond the user-item matrix. In this paper,
  we demonstrate that Factorization Machines can exploit additional representations
  of information inherent in the user-item matrix to improve recommendation performance.
  We refer to our approach as 'Free Lunch' enhancement since it leverages clusters
  that are based on information that is present in the user-item matrix, but not otherwise
  directly exploited during matrix factorization. Borrowing clustering concepts from
  codebook sharing, our approach can also make use of 'Free Lunch' information inherent
  in a user-item matrix from an auxiliary domain that is different from the target
  domain of the recommender. Our approach improves performance both in the joint case,
  in which the auxiliary and target domains share users, and in the disjoint case,
  in which they do not. Although the 'Free Lunch' enhancement does not apply equally
  well to any given domain or domain combination, our overall conclusion is that Factorization
  Machines present an opportunity to exploit information that is ubiquitously present,
  but commonly under-appreciated by Collaborative Filtering algorithms.

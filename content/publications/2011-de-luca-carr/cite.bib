 abstract = {Context-aware information is widely available in various ways such as interaction patterns, location, devices, annotations, query suggestions and user profiles and is becoming more and more important for enhancing retrieval performance and recommendation results. At the moment, the main issue to cope with is not only recommending or retrieving the most relevant items and content, but defining them ad hoc. Other relevant issues are personalizing and adapting the information and the way it is displayed to the user's current situation (device, location) and interests.},

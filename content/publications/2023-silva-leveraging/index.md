abstract: We demonstrate a proof of concept web application that recommends movies
  and generates explanations for the recommendations using Large Language Models (LLMs).
  Specifically, the application uses ChatGPT as both a movie recommender and model
  for generating explanations of the recommendations. The application gathers user
  preferences (liked movies), user goals (type of recommendations), and offers personalized
  recommendations and explanations tailored according to the used-defined goals. In
  this demo, we showcase how recommendations and explanations can be customized according
  to user-defined criteria, such as personalization, novelty, or popularity, and implemented
  using LLMs.

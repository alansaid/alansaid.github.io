abstract: 'As global warming soars, evaluating the environmental impact of research is more critical now than ever before. However, we find that few to no recommender systems research papers document their impact on the environment. Consequently, in this paper, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the environmental impact of recommender system research papers by reproducing a characteristic recommender systems experimental pipeline. We focus on estimating the carbon footprint of recommender systems research papers, highlighting the evolution of the environmental impact of recommender systems research experiments over time. We evaluated all 79 full papers from the ACM RecSys 2013 and 2023 conferences to analyze representative experimental pipelines for papers utilizing traditional, so-called good old-fashioned AI algorithms and deep learning algorithms, respectively. We reproduced these representative experimental pipelines, measured electricity consumption using a hardware energy meter, and converted the measured energy consumption into CO2 equivalents to estimate the environmental impact. Our results show that a recommender systems research paper utilizing deep learning algorithms emits approximately 42 times more CO2 equivalents than a paper utilizing traditional algorithms. Furthermore, such a paper produces, on average, 3,297 kilograms of CO2 equivalents, which is more than one person produces by flying from New York City to Melbourne, or the amount one tree sequesters in 300 years.'

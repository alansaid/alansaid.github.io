 abstract = {Context-aware information is widely available in various ways and is becoming more and more important for enhancing retrieval performance and recommendation results. A primary challenge is not only recommending or retrieving the most relevant items and content, but defining them ad hoc. Other relevant issues include personalizing and adapting the information and the way it is displayed to the userâ€™s current situation and interests. Ubiquitous computing provides new means for capturing user feedback on items and offers information. This year we are particularly interested in contributions investigating how context can influence decision making in contexts such as health, finance, food, education etc. and how systems can exploit context to assert positive behavioral change.},

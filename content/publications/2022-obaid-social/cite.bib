 abstract = {Drone activities in our daily lives are on the rise, so is the need to advance research on how to design drones that can interact with human users in an autonomous and socially acceptable way. The focus of this workshop is to discuss this emerging technology in the context of health and well-being applications. In particular, we take an interdisciplinary approach to understand how to empower drones with more autonomous and AI-driven social features, hence leveraging possible methods, behaviors, and solutions for AI driven social drones in the context of health and well-being. The main activities of this workshop will entail hands on activities and discussions in collaborative format. The expected outcomes aim at building up synergies between participants to lead future steps in the domain of autonomous social drones in health care and well-being.},

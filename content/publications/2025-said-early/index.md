abstract: "As recommender systems increasingly guide physical actions, often through wearables and coaching tools, new challenges arise around how users interpret, trust, and respond to this advice. This paper introduces a conceptual framework for tangible recommendations that influence users' bodies, routines, and well-being. We describe three design dimensions: trust and interpretation, intent alignment, and consequence awareness. These highlight key limitations in applying conventional recommender logic to embodied settings. Through examples and design reflections, we outline how future systems can support long-term well-being, behavioral alignment, and socially responsible personalization."

abstract: In this paper we present the concept of inferred contextual user profiles
  (CUPs) which extends the traditional user profile definition by describing the user
  in a given situation, or context. The approach is evaluated in the scope of movie
  recommendation. In our evaluation, we infer two CUPs for each user, and use only
  one of the profiles, instead of the full user profile for recommending movies. We
  evaluate the model on a data snapshot from the Moviepilot movie recommendation website,
  with results showing a substantial improvement in terms of precision, recall and
  mean average precision.

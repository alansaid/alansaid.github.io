abstract: This book approaches big data, artificial intelligence, machine learning,
  and business intelligence through the lens of Data Science. We have grown accustomed
  to seeing these terms mentioned time and time again in the mainstream media. However,
  our understanding of what they actually mean often remains limited. This book provides
  a general overview of the terms and approaches used broadly in data science, and
  provides detailed information on the underlying theories, models, and application
  scenarios. Divided into three main parts, it addresses what data science is; how
  and where it is used; and how it can be implemented using modern open source software.
  The book offers an essential guide to modern data science for all students, practitioners,
  developers and managers seeking a deeper understanding of how various aspects of
  data science work, and of how they can be employed to gain a competitive advantage.

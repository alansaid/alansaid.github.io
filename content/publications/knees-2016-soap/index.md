abstract: 'The phenomenon often referred to as the “filter-bubble,” i.e., the effect
  that collaborative, as well as content-based recommender systems keep making obvious,
  predictable, redundant, uninspiring, and therefore disengaging suggestions based
  on previous interactions, has emphasized the value of system qualities beyond pure
  accuracy, e.g., diversity, novelty, serendipity, or unexpectedness, to keep the
  user satisfied, e.g., [1, 2, 4]. Apart from the obvious use case in commercial systems
  (where this user satisfaction directly translates to revenue), these additional
  qualities become even more important in other areas. For instance, in creative domains,
  such as music production, we find that similaritybased, “more of the same” recommendations
  have basically no relevance, as illustrated by a quote from a professional music
  producer on the use of recommender systems that could predict his behavior in the
  process of music making: “I would be more interested in something that made me sound
  like the opposite of me [...] cause I can’t do that on my own” (anonymous, during
  interview on location at the Red Bull Music Academy 2014, cf. [3]).'

abstract: In the previous chapters, we have learned how to design group recommender
  systems but did not explicitly discuss how to evaluate them. The evaluation techniques
  for group recommender systems are often the same or similar to those that are used
  for single user recommenders. We show how to apply these techniques on the basis
  of examples and introduce evaluation approaches that are specifically useful in
  group recommendation scenarios.

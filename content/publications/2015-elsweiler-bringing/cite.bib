 abstract = {In this position statement we have discussed recommender systems in the con-text of healthy nutrition. Although recommender systems have previously been proposed as useful tools for helping people achieve a balanced diet, past work has focused purely on estimating what dishes people will like. Here we have out-lined two ways in which the recommendation problem can be reformulated to incorporate aspects of healthy nutrition and demonstrated how these approaches may be implemented. Additionally, we showed that the recipe ratings data sup-plied by users of a recommender system can be used to highlight users who may benefit most from technical assistance.},

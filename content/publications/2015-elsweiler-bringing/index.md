abstract: In this position statement we have discussed recommender systems in the
  con-text of healthy nutrition. Although recommender systems have previously been
  proposed as useful tools for helping people achieve a balanced diet, past work has
  focused purely on estimating what dishes people will like. Here we have out-lined
  two ways in which the recommendation problem can be reformulated to incorporate
  aspects of healthy nutrition and demonstrated how these approaches may be implemented.
  Additionally, we showed that the recipe ratings data sup-plied by users of a recommender
  system can be used to highlight users who may benefit most from technical assistance.

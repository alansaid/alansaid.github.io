abstract: Exploring and revealing relations between the elements is a frequent task
  in exploratory analysis and search. Examples include that of correlations of attributes
  in complex data sets, or faceted search. Common visual representations for such
  relations are directed graphs or correlation matrices. These types of visual encodings
  are often - if not always - fully constructed before being shown to the user. This
  can be thought of as a top-down approach, where users are presented with a full
  picture for them to interpret and understand. Such a way of presenting data could
  lead to a visual overload, specially when it results in complex graphs with high
  degrees of nodes and edges. We propose a bottom-up alternative called Billiard where
  few elements are presented at first and from which a user can interactively construct
  the rest based on what s/he finds of interest. The concept is based on a billiard
  metaphor where a cue ball (node) has an effect on other elements (associated nodes)
  when stroke against them.

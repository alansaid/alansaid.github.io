abstract: This chapter gives a general introduction to data science as a concept and
  to the topics covered in this book. First, we present a rough definition of data
  science, and point out how it relates to the areas of statistics, machine learning
  and big data technologies. Then, we review some of the most relevant tools that
  can be used in data science ranging from optimization to software. We also discuss
  the relevance of building models from data. The chapter ends with a detailed review
  of the structure of the book.

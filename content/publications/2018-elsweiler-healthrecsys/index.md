abstract: The 3rd International Workshop on Health Recommender Systems was held in
  conjunction with the 2018 ACM Conference on Recommender Systems in Vancouver, Canada.
  Following the two prior workshops in 2016 [4] and 2017 [2], the focus of this workshop
  is to deepen the discussion on health promotion, health care as well as health related
  methods. This workshop also aims to strengthen the HealthRecSys community, to engage
  representatives of other health domains into cross-domain collaborations, and to
  exchange and share infrastructure.

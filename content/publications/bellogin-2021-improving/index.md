abstract: Reproducibility is a key requirement for scientific progress. It allows
  the reproduction of the works of others, and, as a consequence, to fully trust the
  reported claims and results. In this work, we argue that, by facilitating reproducibility
  of recommender systems experimentation, we indirectly address the issues of accountability
  and transparency in recommender systems research from the perspectives of practitioners,
  designers, and engineers aiming to assess the capabilities of published research
  works. These issues have become increasingly prevalent in recent literature. Reasons
  for this include societal movements around intelligent systems and artificial intelligence
  striving toward fair and objective use of human behavioral data (as in Machine Learning,
  Information Retrieval, or Human–Computer Interaction). Society has grown to expect
  explanations and transparency standards regarding the underlying algorithms making
  automated decisions for and around us. This work surveys existing definitions of
  these concepts and proposes a coherent terminology for recommender systems research,
  with the goal to connect reproducibility to accountability. We achieve this by introducing
  several guidelines and steps that lead to reproducible and, hence, accountable experimental
  workflows and research. We additionally analyze several instantiations of recommender
  system implementations available in the literature and discuss the extent to which
  they fit in the introduced framework. With this work, we aim to shed light on this
  important problem and facilitate progress in the field by increasing the accountability
  of research.

abstract: Evaluation is important when developing and deploying recommender systems.
  The PERSPECTIVES workshop sheds light on the different, potentially diverging or
  contradictory perspectives on the evaluation of recommender systems. Building on
  the discussions and outcomes of the PERSPECTIVES workshops held at RecSys 2021 and
  2022, the third edition of the PERSPECTIVES workshop held at RecSys 2023 brought
  together researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to reflect on
  the evaluation of recommender systems critically. The workshop featured a keynote
  and focused on the interactive part with discussions in small groups and the plenum.
  We discussed problems and lessons learned, encouraged the exchange of the many perspectives
  on evaluation, and aimed to move the discourse forward within the community.

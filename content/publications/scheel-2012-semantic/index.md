abstract: This work deals with the problem of automatically creating semantic queries
  for knowledge bases from preference feedback. Semantic knowledge bases are a good
  source for retrieving entities for item recommendation. We show that preference
  decisions are not only based on entities, but also on their corresponding predicate-object
  relations. By extracting the weights from trained preference models, the weighted
  predicate-object relations can be stored to a user model. The objective is to use
  such prototype entities in a general user model to formulate semantic queries for
  recommendation retrieval.

abstract: We investigate the problem of item recommendation during the first months
  of the collaborative tagging community CiteULike. CiteULike is a so-called folksonomy
  where users have the possibility to organize publications through annotations -tags.
  Making reliable recommendations during the initial phase of a folksonomy is a difficult
  task, since information about user preferences is meager. In order to improve recommendation
  results during this cold start period, we present a probabilistic approach to item
  recommendation. Our model extends previously proposed models such as probabilistic
  latent semantic analysis (PLSA) by merging both user-item as well as item-tag observations
  into a unified representation. We find that bringing tags into play reduces the
  risk of overfitting and increases overall recommendation quality. Experiments show
  that our approach outperforms other types of recommenders.

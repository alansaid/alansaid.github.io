 abstract = {WrapRec is an easy-to-use Recommender Systems toolkit which allows users to easily implement or wrap recommen- dation algorithms from other frameworks. The main goals of WrapRec are to provide a exible I/O, evaluation mech- anism and code reusability. WrapRec provides a rich data model which makes it easy to implement algorithms for dif- ferent recommender system problems, such as context-aware and cross-domain recommendation. The toolkit is written in C# and the source code is publicly available on Github under the GPL license.},

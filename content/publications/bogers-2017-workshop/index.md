abstract: "Recommendation algorithms for ratings prediction and item ranking have
  steadily matured during the past decade. However, these state-of-the-art algorithms
  are typically applied in relatively straightforward scenarios. In reality, recommendation
  is often a more complex problem: it is usually just a single step in the user's
  more complex background need. These background needs can often place a variety of
  constraints on which recommendations are interesting to the user and when they are
  appropriate. However, relatively little research has been done on these complex
  recommendation scenarios. The ComplexRec 2017 workshop addressed this by providing
  an interactive venue for discussing approaches to recommendation in complex scenarios
  that have no simple one-size-fits-all-solution."

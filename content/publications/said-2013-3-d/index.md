abstract: In this work we describe an approach at multi-objective recommender system
  evaluation based on a previously introduced 3D benchmarking model. The benchmarking
  model takes user-centric, business-centric and technical constraints into consideration
  in order to provide a means of comparison of recommender algorithms in similar scenarios.
  We present a comparison of three recommendation algorithms deployed in a user study
  using this 3D model and compare to standard evaluation methods. The proposed approach
  simplifies benchmarking of recommender systems and al- lows for simple multi-objective
  comparisons. Copyright Â© 2012 by the Association for Computing Machinery, Inc. (ACM).

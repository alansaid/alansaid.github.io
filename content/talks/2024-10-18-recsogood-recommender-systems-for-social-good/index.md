summary: First International Workshop on Recommender Systems for Sustainability and Social Good
abstract: "In this talk, we examine recommender systems through the lens of sustainability, social responsibility, and accountability, with a focus on their alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). As recommender systems continue to influence user behavior, these systems must not only provide recommendations but also support responsible consumption, reduced environmental impact, and social good. We will explore strategies mitigating the carbon footprint of recommendation models, ensure fairness, and create accountability mechanisms, offering practical insights for building recommender systems that contribute to the SDGs, particularly around sustainability and social well-being."

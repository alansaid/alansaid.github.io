summary: RecSys Workshop on Recommenders in Tourism 2025
abstract: "Recommender systems increasingly shape how people travel – what destinations are visited, where to stay, and which experiences to choose. These decisions carry significant environmental, social, and cultural consequences, from carbon emissions and over-tourism to the survival of local communities. This talk examines recommender systems in tourism through a fair and sustainable lens, highlighting the challenges of accountability, fairness, and transparency in guiding responsible travel choices. Drawing on a framework for tangible recommendations, it frames tourism recommendations as not just digital suggestions but embodied decisions with lasting consequences. The talk outlines pathways toward accountability-aware, fair, and consequence-sensitive recommender design that can support more sustainable and responsible forms of tourism."

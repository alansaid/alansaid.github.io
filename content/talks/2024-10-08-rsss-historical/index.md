summary: Recommender Systems Summer School 2024
abstract: "In this talk I give a historical overview of recommender systems. Starting from the modern definition of recommender system in the early 1990 till today's advanced recommendations methods and applications. The presentation bridges recommender systems to related fields, such as information retrieval, information systems, cognitive science, psychology, and machine learning.
